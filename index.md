# About Me
I am currently studying computer science at Virginia Tech. Computer science has always interested me from a young age and I'm diving head-first into the field. I love putting together projects and finding the best ways to structure them for optimization, readability, or expandability. Not to mention machine learning with the potential to revolutionize the future. It's all so interesting and there's so much to learn. I aspire to become a programmer with all of the tools he needs to tackle any type of problem.
# My Projects
### SudokuSolver
Take a screenshot of an online sudoku puzzle and my program will solve it for you. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve it and teseract-ocr to read the nubmers.

### Canvas Grade Checker
CanvasWebScraper.py launches a chrome emulator where you just have to log in to canvas and it will automatically grab existing grades. It then stores these into csv files, updates the Galipatia Database Template.xlsx accordingly, and saves it into a file called updated.xlsx. If you run UpdateFromCSV.py directly, it uses the existing csv files from a previous run to update the spreadsheet.
